I still remember vividly the rush of excitement when I wrote my first piece of 'official' code in Python `print("Hello World!")`. Today, as I pen down my first article to document my motivations for venturing into Tech and Product Management, it seems fitting for the title of this post to be `"Hello, World!"`.

## My previous life

Prior to Tech, my previous life was in Strategy & Operations, working with C-suite, in an Indonesian conglomerate. Although the company was mainly dealing in commodities, it had diversified donwstream into Consumer Goods and Supply Chain & Distribution. 

This was my first job right after graduating university, and I spent a total of 5 years there, from 2015 to 2020. Looking back, I am extremely grateful for the opportunity to have had such a unique work experience right after graduating. It was there I had:

* **Experienced the lowest of low, and the highest of highs** - Started off as a clueless fresh graduate, and almost failed probation because I knew next to nothing about the industry, dealing with upper management, and the operations & inner-workings of the company. Eating that humble pie and stripping all my ego away was the best thing that happened to me as all I had left was the hunger and determination to make a success out of myself. With the extreme fortune of a wonderful mentor and a generous boss who believed in giving youth an opportunity, I was able to build myself back up, and go from strength to strength with each successful project delivered. 

* **Huge personal growth** - Growth not only from the skillset acquired, but also from a deeper understanding of myself as a person: 
    - Skillsets: Problem-solving, stakeholder management, project management, strategy, leadership, and communication
    - Deeper understanding of myself: Success to me is being able to drive sustainable, long-term positive impact to the business. I love working with like-minded and driven team players, and I hate working with snakeoil salesmen and individuals who aren't team players.

* **Multi-industry experience** - The projects I worked on rotated across various business units which were operating in different industries; Commodities Trading, Palm Oil, Oleochemicals, Soybeans, Consumer Packaged Goods, Distribution, and Supply Chain. While the rotations kept work fresh and exciting, I had to leverage my learning to reach a satisfactory level that is able to effectively drive the project forward and deliver success.  

* **Global working experience** - Spent 4 years in Indonesia and 1 year in China where I had many wonderful memories, and made friends for life. Having this global work experience also helped me better appreciate the differences in work mentality between the different cultures, and also new perspectives of how unique and different my country, Singapore, is.

If given a choice all over again, I would still choose the same role after graduation, but I would be wise to make different mistakes the second time round, and also better prepare and accelerate plans for my next role in Tech.  

## Why Tech

I first started planning for the next step in my career back in 2018. It was then I decided that my next role will be in Tech as:

* (*Logos*) Firm believer in a Tech-driven future - What is clear, is that the traditional world will be disrupted up by their digital counterparts as the scale and efficiency made possible by digital technology and connectivity will change the way society has functioned and interacted traditionally. Prominent exaxmples of this would be ride-hailing and e-commerce. In addition, the logical consequence of this digital revolution would be a redistribution of the economic pie towards the digital camp. Thus from both a growth and an economics perspective, Tech would be my field of choice.

* (*Pathos*) Personal passion for programming & new technologies - I have always enjoyed learning new tools and also dabbling in programming to increase my own productivity - Matlab, VBA, Excel PowerTools (Dax expressions), Python, Machine Learning. For me, it is extremely empowering, to be able to communicate with computers and leverage their computing powers to build your own programs/stuff in the digital space.

To get my toes wet, I took a 3 months sabbatical towards the end of 2018 to pursue a full-time immersive in Data Science, which would upskill me further in the field of analytics (highly useful in my Strategy & Ops role), and also equip me with the necessary programming skills to train my own machine learning model. These 3 months in Singapore had also been a good break for me, as I was close to burning out after working at a high octane for the past 3 years and I terribly missed my friends and family back in Singapore.    

## Why Product Management

After deciding on *where*, came the more difficult question of *what*, and for my next role, I contemplated between a:

* **Pivot towards Software Engineering or Data Science** - which would appeal to the hobbyist programmer / analytics nerd in me, and also equip me with a technical skillset that empowers me to create my own programs / applications; or

* **Transition towards Product Management** - which would have more overlaps with my skillsets and experience, and the role is more strategically postioned to drive major-product decision as it lies in the intersection of business, user experience, and tech.

Coincidentally, my then-company started a corporate tech start-up in the e-commerce and distribution space, which provided me with the exposure to the different roles in tech. In the end, Product Management appealed to me more as I wanted to be in the driver's seat for the product's success, and I would be better positioned to significantly value-add given my past working experiences.

And by a huge stroke of luck (and preparation), I was able to subsequently land a Product role with a tech startup (based in Singapore!) and have had quite an incredible Product journey with them for the past 16 months. That would be a story for future articles. Till then, take care and stay safe!
